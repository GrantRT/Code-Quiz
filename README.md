# Code-Quiz

## Introduction

I was given a task to create a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores.

## Technology Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Summary

When the user clicks "Begin Quiz" they are presented with their first question and the timer starts counting down. Once an answer is selected they move on to the next question, however, if their answer is incorrect 10 seconds are deducted from the timer, therefore reducing their overall score.

Once the the quiz is completed the user can enter their initials and save their score to a leaderboard using local storage. They are also able to clear their leadboard if they wish to do so.
